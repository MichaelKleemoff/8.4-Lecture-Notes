## Wireframes
- What is a view?
A view is what the user sees - what they experience;

- What are wireframes?
a rough sketch of what our views look like
they can be simple  or they can be quite complex

- When should we use them?
we want to make these at the start of our development process

- How many wireframes should an app have?
this depends on the project and how specific we want to get

- Lets make one


## Trello
- What is a `User Story`?
A way to write about feature in an applicaiton from the a users perspective;
Example:
Good:
        As a customer, I want to navigate to the index page and see a seperate 
        list of my transactions by whether they are positive or negative
Good:
        As a banker, I want to see a list of all customers on my customers index page 
Bad:
        index shows transactions
- How do we write one?
As a type of user, I want to do some goal, so that something happens for some reason.

- What 5 lists are on a basic `Trello`
    - Todo - we need this to keep a record of what needs to get done
    - Design - a record of all our design resources
    - Doing - what people are currently doing in this sprint
    - Done - a list of things we have accomplished
    - Backlog - this is the list of what needs to be accomplished but not currently needed in this sprint

- Lets make an example board

## Setting Exepctaions
- New Slack channel
        - The #8-4-Project-Support channel has been created to provide further assistance for our class while Gigi is away. Instructors have volunteered their time to be available to help with bugs from 10am - 6pm Monday-Friday.

- How to ask for help moving forward
        - During this project you will only receive help if your question has a link to your teams trello board and the bug has been documented.  

- Stand ups and Trello
        - Stand ups will be held with each team on Wednesday 8/17
        and Sunday 8/21 to discuss your app's progress.  
        You are expected to keep your Trello board up to date as instructors will use it to guage your progress and participation.
